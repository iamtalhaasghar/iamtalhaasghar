### Crafting Code 💻 | Solving Problems 💡 | Constantly Learning 🧠 

Holding a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science 🎓, I have gained expertise in several programming languages including Python 🐍, JavaScript 🔥, and C++. As a freelance developer, I have honed my skills in delivering innovative and impactful solutions 💥.

Specializing in Machine Learning 🤖 and Data Science 📈, I have completed Coursera courses such as "Python for Everybody" and "Machine Learning by deeplearning.ai" to stay on top of the latest developments. With a strong foundation in tools such as TensorFlow, Pandas and Numpy, I am able to tackle complex problems with ease 💡.

A true tech enthusiast, I am always on the lookout for the latest developments in the Metaverse and NFTs. As a privacy advocate, I prefer using Linux and am comfortable working with Terminal tools 🐧💻.

Aside from coding, I have a passion for teaching and have mentored my peers in programming, sharing my knowledge and helping them to reach their full potential 🤓.

Join me in my journey of exploring new technologies and creating impactful solutions 🚀 #FullStackDeveloper #MachineLearning #DataScience #Python #JavaScript #Linux #Freelance #Mentor #Metaverse #NFTs
